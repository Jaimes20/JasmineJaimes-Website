        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside and am majoring in Psychology. I plan on obtaining my bachelor's degree and go on to work in some law enforcement position. Although Iâ€™m not quite certain on what exact law enforcement job I would like, I am between two. My options consist of either DEA or FBI as a field officer or special agent. I have been told by many people that the job is quite tough but Iâ€™m willing to take the risk and like the adrenaline. These types of jobs are no joke as you are putting your life at the line every single day but I have been enthusiastic about this job ever since I was a little girl. And I am convinced that as long as I am not only able to enjoy this job but do it for a good cause for the greater good than itâ€™s okay. Though I am aware jobs like these do require quite the experience that is why I have created a plan for myself. This plan consists of course continuing my education at my university and within this second and third year to get an internship at either my universityâ€™s security department or a near police department. Meanwhile I am still doing my education.<br><br>

        With this bit of experience Iâ€™d be able to not only secure a job after I graduate but also gain the experience I need to later apply at the FBI or DEA. Though they also require physical endurance in order to pass the physical test which is also an important part in the job. For this I have started to start on getting physically fit slowly but surely and will continue doing so for the next few years before I apply. This might even then not assure me the job because itâ€™s very tough to get a job like this but Iâ€™m willing to keep reapplying and doing better if my first time doesnâ€™t work out. 
<br><br>

        I was born and raised in California. I am currently 20 years old and am Hispanic. I do not have much job experience but the very few job experience I have have been in fast food restaurants. I have also worked in agriculture before but that is about it. Though just because I donâ€™t have much job experience does not mean that Iâ€™m not willing to take a job. Inclusively Iâ€™m willing to learn and perform my very best. I am actually quite a fast learner and am easily able to accommodate to many environments. I am a very outgoing person and am able to get along with people. From my job experience I have learned to work hard regardless of the type of job that you are working at because a job is a blessing. I donâ€™t come from a very rich background but my parents have given me everything that they could and I have been able to use every opportunity wisely to do better.
